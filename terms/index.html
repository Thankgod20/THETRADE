           <p>10. Bonus Policy</p>
           
           <p>SmartBuzzCrypto offers a number of attractive reward features to its new and subsisting clients. Bonuses and one time trading credits awarded to clients are part of SmartBuzzCrypto’s promotional programmes. These bonuses are limited time offers and the terms and conditions associated with bonus rewards are subject to change.</p>
           
           <p>SmartBuzzCrypto reserves the right to refuse, cancel or change the bonus at any time without any prior notice. Any indication of fraud, manipulation, cash-back arbitrage or other forms of deceitful or fraudulent activity based on the provision of the bonus will render the account inactive along with any and all profits or losses garnered.</p>
           
           <p>Bonuses are optional and client is not required to take a bonus. During initial deposit, client may send a request to support@SmartBuzzCrypto.com to accept no bonus and therefore is exempt to any conditions pertaining to bonuses, however the rest of the terms in this Agreement still apply. Should client mistakenly accept a bonus, client must notify customer support within 3 working days, and must place no trades. In such an instance, SmartBuzzCrypto will remove bonus from client account and client shall not be held to the terms relating to bonuses, however all terms and conditions will still apply.</p>
           
           <p>When trading CFD, Bonus is used only as an additional margin for order volume increase, as a leverage and can’t be withdrawn. </p>
           
           <p>11. Withdrawal Procedure and Fees</p>
           
           <p>SmartBuzzCrypto finance department handles all withdrawal requests submitted. From the time the request is made, SmartBuzzCrypto normally process each withdrawal request within 1 hour.

           <p>The SmartBuzzCrypto finance team will determine the method of withdrawal. Client cannot request to change a withdrawal method. All funds must be returned to the source of the original deposit. However, in some cases, this may not be possible (such as in cases where the original deposit source was a MasterCard).

Mobile phone bills and other general mail will not satisfy this requirement. If the SmartBuzzCrypto account has been funded using multiple credit or debit cards, the SmartBuzzCrypto finance department will require copies of all cards used before a withdrawal is approved.</p>

           <p>- When sending bank statements, please ensure the name and address information are visible, as well as the transfer sent to the company. You should then conceal all other information.</p>

           <p>Once the withdrawal has been approved, please allow an additional 5 to 6 working days for the funds to show in a client account. Please note that larger withdrawal amounts may take additional time as they may be subject to fraud checks by the processing and receiving banks. These additional checks are not performed by, or at the request of, SmartBuzzCrypto and we do not have control over this process.</p>
           
           <p>Any withdrawal that must be completed by international wire transfer will be charged an upfront $50 transfer fee.</p>

           <p><strong>16. Terms for trading CFDs</strong></p>
           <p><strong>General terms and bonuses</strong>
           It’s not permitted to trade CFD, if total account loss is exceeding total amount of deposits on the account.
           
           When trading CFD, if balance drops to the level of bonus, an automatic closing of all open trades takes place - Margin call.
           
           Example: You deposited $1000 and got bonus of $1000. If the loss in your account equals to $1000, bonus is automatically withdrawn and open trades are closed.
           </p>
           <p><strong>Price</strong>: The price for a given contract is calculated by reference to the price of the relevant underlying financial instrument. For any given CFD, the Company will quote two prices: the higher price (ASK) at which the Client can buy (go long) that CFD, and the lower price (BID) at which the Client can sell (go short) that CFD. Collectively, the ASK and BID prices are referred to as the Company&rsquo;s prices and can be found on the Company&rsquo;s trading platform.</p>
           <p>The difference between the lower and the higher price of a given CFD is the spread.</p>
           <p>Prices will be obtained from reputable third-party price feeders and provided by the Company. Prices are updated frequently as the limitations of technology and communication links allow.</p>
           <p>The Company ensures that the Client will receive the best price by guaranteeing that the calculation of the quoted prices is made with reference and compared to a range of underlying price providers and data sources. The Company additionally ensures to monitor its Execution Venue(s) on an ongoing basis and review their performance at least annually to confirm that relevant and competitive pricing is offered.</p>
           <p>Please note that despite taking reasonable steps to obtaining best possible results for Clients, the Company is unable to guarantee, when executing orders, that the prices offered will be more favourable that prices that might be available elsewhere.</p>
           <p>Under certain trading conditions, the Client should note that it may be impossible to execute an Order at their requested price. In such cases the Company reserves the right to execute the Order at the first available price. Such instances may occur during times of high market volatility and price fluctuations e.g. when the price of an asset rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that, under the rules of the relevant exchange, trading is suspended or restricted.</p>
           <p><strong>Costs</strong>: In most circumstances, a spread is applied. The spread is dynamic for certain Financial Instruments, and may take into account such factors as liquidity in external markets for the underlying financial instrument and competitive pricing. The Company reserves the right to charge the Client a swap fee (of 0.07% of the face value of the position) for keeping a position open overnight. This swap fee can be subject to changes in the future. The swap fee is calculated as the rounded result of the following formula: ((23%)/360) + Libor rate.</p>
           <p>The Company reserves the right to charge a commission for opening an unleveraged Cryptocurrency CFD trading position which shall vary from 1% to 2.5% of the transaction. For leveraged CFD cryptocurrency positions, the Company will charge a commission fee of up to 5% of the transaction.</p>
           <p>In certain circumstances (such as increased volatility or illiquidity in relation to the underlying market concerned) the Company reserves the right to alter the spreads offered.</p>
           <p>In other circumstances, clients may be charged overnight funding premiums.</p>
           <p>The Company reserves the right to, at any time, apply such charges in the future with prior notice to the Client. Such notice may be sent personally to the Client and/or posted on the Company&rsquo;s website in the section General Fees. Should the Company at any period of time decide not to charge any costs, it shall not be construed as a waiver of its rights to apply them in the future.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           <p><strong>Speed of Execution</strong>: The Company strives to offer a high speed of execution however, in certain circumstances, for example low internet speed or market volatility, the quoted price may no longer be representative of the underlying market price and may result in the Client placing his/her Order at a delay, this may result in orders being executed at a better or worse prevailing price offered by the Company.</p>
           <p>&nbsp;</p>
           <p><strong>Likelihood of Execution</strong>: The Company arranges for the execution of Client orders with the Execution Venue, as such, execution may at times be difficult. The likelihood of execution depends on the availability of the prices of the Execution Venue(s). In some instances, it may not be possible to arrange an Order for execution during abnormal market conditions. This can occur, but is not limited to, the following examples: overnight, during news times, the opening of trading sessions, volatile markets (where prices may move significantly up or down and away from declared prices), where there is rapid price movement, where there is insufficient liquidity for the execution of the specific volume at the declared price or a force majeure event has occurred.</p>
           <p>In the event that the Company is unable to proceed with an Order in relation to price or size or any reason, the Order will be executed at the first available price or not executed at all. In addition, please note, that the Company is entitled, at any time and at its discretion, without giving any notice or explanation to the Client, to decline or refuse to transmit or arrange for the execution of any Order or request of the Client in circumstances explained in the Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>
           <p>The Company does not accept any orders outside of the market hours of the relevant underlying financial instrument.</p>
           <p><strong>Likelihood of Settlement</strong>: The Company shall proceed to the settlement of all transactions upon execution of such transactions. The CFDs offered by the Company do not involve the delivery of the underlying asset, so they are not settled physically as there would be for example if the Client had bought Shares. All CFDs are cash settled.</p>
           <p>The Company shall proceed with the settlement of all transactions upon the execution and/or time of expiration of the specific transaction.</p>
           <p><strong>Size of Order</strong>: All orders are placed in monetary values. The Client is able to place an order as long as they have enough balance in their trading account. The minimum size of an Order may be different for each type of CFD, please refer to the Company&rsquo;s trading platform for the value of the minimum size of an Order in each CFD, as well as the value of the maximum size of a single Order.</p>
           <p>If the Client wishes to execute a large Order, in some cases the price may become less favourable. The Company reserves the right to decline an Order in case the size of the Order is large and cannot be filled by the Company.</p>
           <p><strong>Market Impact</strong>: Some factors may rapidly affect the price of the underlying instrument/product from which the Company&rsquo;s quoted price is derived and may also affect other factors listed herein. The Company will take all reasonable steps to obtain the best possible result for its Clients.</p>
           <p>The Company does not consider the above list exhaustive and the order in which the above factors are presented shall not be taken as priority factor.</p>
           <p><strong>Different Types of CFDs</strong>: The Company offers the following types of CFDs on its platform:</p>
           <ul>
           <li>Forex: CFDs in currency pairs (FX)</li>
           <li>CFD stocks</li>
           <li>"Crypto": CFDs in Cryptocurrencies</li>
           </ul>
           <p><strong>Types of Orders</strong>: The Client may give instruction to execute or initiate a trade with the Company by way of:</p>
           <ul>
           <li><strong>Market Order</strong>: whereby the Client gives instructions to immediately buy or sell at the best available price.</li>
           </ul>
           <p><strong>17. Execution Practices in CFDs</strong></p>
           <p><strong>Slippage</strong>: You are warned that Slippage may occur when trading in CFDs. Slippage is the difference between the expected price of an Order, and the price the Order is actually executed at. In some situations, at the time an Order is presented for execution, the specific price shown to the Client may not be available; therefore, the Order will be executed close to or a number of pips away from the Client&rsquo;s requested price.</p>
           <p>Slippage can occur at times of low liquidity or high volatility (e.g. after economic events or news announcements) and is a normal element of trading in CFDs.</p>
           <p><strong>Leverage (Multiplier)</strong>: The use of the multiplier tool in CFD trading enables the client to trade in the markets and increase proportionally the returns of his/her invested amount, in relation to the returns in the market. However, the maximum loss a client can incur from a trade is limited to his/her original investment amount meaning the remaining amount of his/her equity is secured. The Company applies a maximum multiplier of 1:100 for all clients by default, in line with relevant legislation.</p>
           <p>E.g. (for long positions with 1:50 multiplier): A trader decides to invest &euro;1,000 (Investment Amount) on the upwards movement of EUR/USD. He/she also chooses to use a multiplier of 50 for this trade. After one day, the trader decides to close the position. At that moment, the price of EUR/USD moved from 1.153250 (opening price) to 1.158000 (closing price) or otherwise 0.41188%. The realised profit for the client will be &euro;205.94 or otherwise 20.594%. To better understand the calculations, the invested capital increased by the percentage move in the market multiplied by the multiplier (0.41188% x 50 = 20.594%).</p>
           <p>(Closing Price / Opening Price -1) x Multiplier x Investment Amount = Profit/Loss</p>
           <p>i.e. (1.158000 / 1.153250 -1) x 50 x 1000 = 205.93973553 or &euro;205.94</p>
           <p>For short positions: i.e (1-closing price / opening price)&nbsp;<em>Multiplier</em>&nbsp;Investment Amount = Profit/Loss.</p>
           <p>Without the use of the multiplier tool the trader&rsquo;s profit would have been 4.1187947106 or &euro;4.12.</p>
           <p>In the opposite scenario, if the market had moved against his/her position, the realised losses would have been larger with the use of the multiplier compared to a position opened without the use of it. To demonstrate with the same example, if the market had moved 1% down from the opening price of 1.153250, because of the use of the multiplier tool, the invested capital will decrease by 50% (1% x 50).</p>
           <p>i.e. 1% x 50 x 1000 = &euro;500</p>
           <p>Without the use of the multiplier tool, the trader&rsquo;s losses would have been &euro;10.</p>
           <p>If the trader had used a lower multiplier both the profit and loss amount in the examples above, would have been smaller as well.</p>
           <p>E.g. Using a multiplier of 20, the realised profit in the first example would be (1.158000 / 1.153250 -1) x 20 x 1000 = 82.374 or &euro;82.40 and 1% x 20 x &euro;1,000 = &euro;200 for the second example.</p>
           <p>As it will be explained more in Maintenance Margin section the trader will never lose more that the investment amount of a position.</p>
           <p>It should be noted that the Company may offer higher multipliers to clients it considers to possess the necessary knowledge, experience and understanding of the high risks involved with trading with leverage. Leverage restrictions may apply to certain instruments and/or jurisdictions.</p>
           <p>Warning: Trading CFDs carries a high level of risk since the multiplier tool (leverage) can work both in your advantage and disadvantage. As a result, it may not be suitable for all investors because you may lose all your invested capital.</p>
           <p><strong>Maintenance Margin</strong>: The Maintenance Margin is the minimum amount of equity in a position required to maintain the open position. Should this amount fall below 5% of the initial investment, the Company will automatically close the position.</p>
           <p>E.g. Using the data from the previous example with &euro;1,000 investment in EURUSD and using a multiplier of 50, the maintenance margin is calculated as 5% x &euro;1,000 = &euro;50. Therefore, the maximum loss the trader can occur, before their position is closed by the Company is 95% or &euro;950 (If the trader has not already closed the position themselves).</p>
           <p>The price when the position will be closed by the Company, and only if the trader hasn&rsquo;t decided to already close the position, is 1.131338. At this price, the remaining amount of the investment will have reached the maintenance margin.</p>
           <p>To better understand the calculations the return in the market when 95% of the investment amount will be lost is 1.9% on the downside since the position is long the EURUSD.</p>
           <p>Maximum Loss / multiplier = return in market.</p>
           <p>i.e. 95% / 50 = 1.9%*</p>
           <p>For an opening price of 1.153250, a 1.9% decline will cause the price to move to 1.131338.</p>
           <p>Opening Price x (1 &ndash; return in market) = price when position will be closed.</p>
           <p>i.e. 1.153250 x (1-1.9%) = 1.131338</p>
           <ul>
           <li>In majority of situations, position will be automatically closed as soon as it declines by 95%. It can happen that the position will be closed in a range between 95% and 100%, such situations can occur at times of low liquidity or high volatility (e.g. after economic events or news announcements) and is a normal element of trading in CFDs.</li>
           </ul>
           <p>In case of 100% loss, calculations will be like this:</p>
